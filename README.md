# T-Pad
- The T-Pad is a basic telemetry module that will track different metrics using 4 main sensors and then send those metrics to a web dashboard. I made this project as an intro into sensors to use as reference to future projects with sensors and data being fed back to a main dashboard.

# How it works
- The board's brain is a RP2040 Zero that will then send info back to the computer via USB. The board features the following:
  -   A BME280 to track temperature and humidity
  -   A RP2040 as the brain
  -   An INA 219 to track voltage supply
  -   BH1750 to track light intensity
  -   A BMI 270 as a gyroscope and accelerometer
